excerpt: 
  We want to share our happiness by sponsoring one hundred poor
  talents of Nepal to continue their higher education. During our
  marriage ceremony, we received many Dakshina and gifts as love
  and blessing from both sides of our family, and relatives.
  Amrita and I decided that we will donate collected Dakshina
  amount of $1,000 to help school kids to pursue their college
  dream.

              <p>
                By the year 2025, the dream of 100 kids to go to college will
                become reality. Every year we will select 10 to 15 deserving
                talents of Pyuthan Nepal and we will cover the entire cost of
                two years of college education (i.e. grade 11 and 12). We will
                donate $1,000 every year until the 100th kid completes his/her
                college degree.
              </p>

                I know many friends want to join hands with us together to help
                shepherd and grazier of mountains to pursue their college dream.
                You might be watching our wedding video on a smartphone but in
                some corners of Nepal, people can not afford to pay a year of
                college fee of just 50 dollars. With your help and a small
                donation, dream100 will be a reality sooner.
