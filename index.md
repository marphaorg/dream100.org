# A Dream to educate 100 kids

[Amrita](https://www.facebook.com/amrita.sen1111) and I([Suvash](https://www.facebook.com/iamsuvash)) are blessed to say that, on December 1st, 2020, we got married in front of two hundred family, friends, and relatives at Hotel Sneha Nepalgunj, Nepal. 

We want to share our happiness by sponsoring one hundred poor talents of Nepal to continue their higher education.

During our marriage ceremony, we received many Dakshina and gifts as love and blessing from both sides of our family, and relatives. Amrita and I decided that we will donate collected Dakshina amount of $1,000 to help school kids to pursue their college dream.

By the year 2025, the dream of 100 kids to go to college will become reality. Every year we will select 10 to 15 deserving talents of Pyuthan Nepal and we will cover the entire cost of two years of college education (i.e. grade 11 and 12). We will donate $1,000 every year until the 100th kid completes his/her college degree. 

I know many friends want to join hands with us together to help shepherd and grazier of mountains to pursue their college dream. You might be watching our wedding video on a smartphone but in some corners of Nepal, people can not afford to pay a year of college fee of just 50 dollars. With your help and a small donation, dream100 will be a reality sooner.

If you want to know more or be part of the Dream100 project, please contact us.
